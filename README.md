## Known Issues & Todos

1. **Missing Pages**:
   - The `/about` route references `src/pages/about.tsx`, which does not exist.
   - **Fix**: Implement React Router for client-side navigation or create the missing page components.

2. **Empty Sections**:
   - The Hero Section and "Why Choose Us" in `App.tsx` are incomplete.
   - **Fix**: Add content and visuals to these sections.

3. **Routing Configuration**:
   - Clicking navigation links (e.g., `/about`) will cause 404 errors without a router.
   - **Fix**: Install `react-router-dom` and configure routes.

4. **Static Data**:
   - Only one property is defined in `featuredProperties`. Add more entries for a realistic demo.

5. **Search Functionality**:
   - The search form in `SearchBar.tsx` lacks an `onSubmit` handler.
   - **Fix**: Connect to a state management solution or API.

6. **About Page Setup**:
   - `about.html` uses a separate HTML file, which is unconventional for React SPAs.
   - **Fix**: Migrate to a React component-based approach with routing.
